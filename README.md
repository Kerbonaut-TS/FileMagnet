# FileMagnet (WIP)
Place it in a folder with images to attract similar files to its location


The idea of file magnet is to have a portable app that you can move from folder to folder,
and allow within few clicks move all similar images to the same location.
It was ideated to optimize a photography workflow and organize image selections in the file explorer.

Example: 

1. place the app in a folder with images.
2. launch the jar/exe 
3. similarity rules are pre-filled based pn the folder conntent (customize if necessary)
4. select the target
5. press start.


### Attraction logic and similarity rules

attract files with 

- same extension
- same name (but different extension)
- same timestamp (Exactly the same time taken)
- exactly same content but different name (WIP)
- similar but not same image content (WIP)
